VSFeedSpeed is a simple feed and speed calculator for CNC Routing, particularly for wood and plastics. Its goals are to be simple to use, cross-platform, open source, well researched, and well documented.

# Surface Speed
When searching for CNC router feeds and speeds online, most sources will assume RPMs in the 12000 to 20000 range, then calculate the feedrate based on an assumed RPM. It is unclear why they don't account for surface speed, though my best guess is that they're started at single speed routers.

For those resources that are based on surface speed, further time should be spent investigating the experimental basis of their surface speed values.

As examples, Amana presents tables independent of surface speed (https://www.amanatool.com/pub/media/productattachments/Solid-Carbide-Compression-Spirals-v12.pdf). Whereas the resources here (https://pub.pages.cba.mit.edu/feed_speeds/) and here (https://tinyurl.com/4fkk8hze) rely on surface speed but do not provide any reference for their values.
